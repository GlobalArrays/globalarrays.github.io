<h1>Exclusive Access File Library</h1>

<p>An exclusive access file is a file which is generated and/or read by a
single process of a distributed parallel application. Files are not shared
between different processes. The  library is an abstract high-performance file
system which provides a common interface for a variety of architecture specific
parallel storage systems.  The library also makes available features like
asynchronous input and output to Fortran.  EAF's syntax is similar to the
standard Unix C file operations, differences indicate new semantics or extended
features available through EAF.</p>
