<h1>Libraries within GA</h1>

<p>The Global Arrays toolkit consists of many useful and related pieces.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../comex">Communication Runtime for Extreme Scale
        (ComEx)</a> provides vector and strided interfaces to optimize
    performance of remote memory copy operations for non-contiguous data.</li>
    <li><a href="pario/index.html">ChemIO aka Parallel IO (pario)</a> is a
    package consisting of three independent parallel I/O libraries for
    high-performance computers. It was designed for computational chemistry;
    however, the supported abstractions and features are general enough to be
    of interest to other applications.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="pario/dra.html">Disk Resident Arrays</a> extend the GA
        Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) programming model to disk.</li>
        <li><a href="pario/sf/">Shared Files</a> to which multiple processors
        can read and write independently.</li>
        <li><a href="pario/EAFapi.html">Exclusive Access Files (EAF)</a>
        per-processor private files.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="ma/index.html">Memory Allocator (MA)</a> is a local memory
    manager/allocator with several useful features not available in Fortran or
    C languages.</li>
    <li><a href="http://hpc.pnl.gov/tascel/">Task Scheduling
        Library (tascel)</a></li>
    <li><a href="tcgmsg/index.html">TCGMSG</a> is an efficient but limited in
    functionality (comparing to MPI) message-passing library available on many
    current (and legacy) systems.</li>
    <li><a href="tcgmsg-mpi/index.html">TCGMSG-MPI</a> is a portability layer
    between TCGMSG and MPI. It is recommended as a transition library from
    TCGMSG to MPI for existing TCGMSG codes.</li>
</ul>
