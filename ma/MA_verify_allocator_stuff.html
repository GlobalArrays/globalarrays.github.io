     MA_VERIFY_ALLOCATOR_STUFF


     <B>NAME</B>
	  MA_verify_allocator_stuff - sanity check the internal	state
	  of MA

     <B>C SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "macdecls.h"

	  Boolean MA_verify_allocator_stuff()

     <B>FORTRAN SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "mafdecls.h"

	  logical function MA_verify_allocator_stuff()

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
	  MA_verify_allocator_stuff() checks each block	currently
	  allocated on the heap	or the stack for checksum and guard
	  errors. For each error found,	a message is printed on	the
	  standard output (stdout). If any errors are found, a summary
	  message is printed on	the standard error (stderr), else
	  nothing is printed.

     <B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
	  unavailable; recompile MA with -DVERIFY
	       To use this routine, MA must be compiled	with cpp
	       option -DVERIFY.

	  %s block '%s', handle	%d, address 0x%lx:
	       The following diagnostics are each prefixed by this
	       information, which identifies the corrupted block.

	  current checksum %lu != stored checksum %lu
	       This indicates that the block has been corrupted	by
	       having its internal state overwritten.
	  current left signature %u != proper left signature %u
	       This indicates that the block has been corrupted	by
	       being overwritten at the	left end. The likely cause of
	       this is an application indexing bug.
	  current right	signature %u !=	proper right signature %u
	       This indicates that the block has been corrupted	by
	       being overwritten at the	right end. The likely cause of
	       this is an application indexing bug.

     <B>RETURN VALUE</B>
	  C: MA_TRUE upon success (no errors), MA_FALSE	upon failure
	  (errors).
	  FORTRAN: .true. upon success (no errors), .false. upon
	  failure (errors).
