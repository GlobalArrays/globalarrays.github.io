     MA_GET_POINTER


     <B>NAME</B>
	  MA_get_pointer - get the base	pointer	for a block

     <B>C SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "macdecls.h"

	  Boolean MA_get_pointer(memhandle, pointer)
	      Integer	  memhandle;	  /* read-only */
	      Pointer	  *pointer;	  /* write-only	*/

     <B>FORTRAN SYNOPSIS</B>
	  Not available.

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
	  MA_get_pointer() returns in <I>pointer </I>the base pointer for the
	  block	corresponding to the handle <I>memhandle </I>(which was
	  returned by MA_allocate_heap() or MA_push_stack() when the
	  block	was allocated).

     <B>USAGE</B>
	  The following	C code illustrates the use of MA_get_pointer()
	  by allocating	a block	of 5 integers on the heap and then
	  storing values into the integers.

	  #include "macdecls.h"

	      Boolean ok;
	      Integer mhandle;
	      Pointer pointer;
	      int     i;

	      ok = MA_allocate_heap(MT_INT, 5, "heap int block",
	  &ampmhandle);
	      if (ok)
	      {
		  ok = MA_get_pointer(mhandle, &amppointer);
		  if (ok)
		      for (i = 0; i &lt 5; i++)
			  *((int *)pointer + i)	= 0;
	      }

     <B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
	  invalid memhandle: %d
	       <I>memhandle </I>is not	a valid	handle.
	  invalid checksum for memhandle %d (name: '%s')
	       The block's computed checksum does not match its	stored
	       checksum. This indicates	that the block has been
	       corrupted by having its internal	state overwritten.
	  invalid guard(s) for memhandle %d (name: '%s')
	       This indicates that the block has been corrupted	by
	       being overwritten at one	or both	ends. The likely cause
	       of this is an application indexing bug.
	  memhandle %d (name: '%s') not	in heap	or stack
	       The block is not	currently allocated in the heap	or the
	       stack.

	  Other	diagnostics are	possible. If seen, they	indicate
	  corruption of	the internal state of MA, caused by bugs in
	  either MA or the application.

     <B>RETURN VALUE</B>
	  C: MA_TRUE upon success, MA_FALSE upon failure.
	  FORTRAN: Not available.

     <B>NOTES</B>
	  MA_get_pointer() is not available in FORTRAN,	because
	  FORTRAN does not support pointers.
