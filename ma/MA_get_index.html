     MA_GET_INDEX


     <B>NAME</B>
	  MA_get_index - get the base index for	a block

     <B>C SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "macdecls.h"

	  Boolean MA_get_index(memhandle, index)
	      Integer	  memhandle;	  /* read-only */
	      Integer	  *index;	  /* write-only	*/

     <B>FORTRAN SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "mafdecls.h"

	  logical function MA_get_index(memhandle, index)
	      integer	  memhandle
	      integer	  index

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
	  MA_get_index() returns in <I>index </I>the base index for the type-
	  specific data	array that is appropriate for the block
	  corresponding	to the handle <I>memhandle</I>	(which was returned by
	  MA_allocate_heap() or	MA_push_stack()	when the block was
	  allocated).

     <B>USAGE</B>
	  The following	FORTRAN	code illustrates the use of
	  MA_get_index() by allocating a block of 5 integers on	the
	  heap and then	storing	values into the	integers.

	  #include "mafdecls.h"

	      logical ok
	      integer mhandle
	      integer index
	      integer i

	      ok = MA_allocate_heap(MT_INT, 5, 'heap int block',
	  mhandle)
	      if (ok) then
		  ok = MA_get_index(mhandle, index)
		  if (ok) then
		      do 10 i =	0, 4
			  int_mb(index + i) = 0
	  10	      continue
		  endif
	      endif

     <B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
	  invalid memhandle: %d
	       <I>memhandle </I>is not	a valid	handle.
	  invalid checksum for memhandle %d (name: '%s')
	       The block's computed checksum does not match its	stored
	       checksum. This indicates	that the block has been
	       corrupted by having its internal	state overwritten.
	  invalid guard(s) for memhandle %d (name: '%s')
	       This indicates that the block has been corrupted	by
	       being overwritten at one	or both	ends. The likely cause
	       of this is an application indexing bug.
	  memhandle %d (name: '%s') not	in heap	or stack
	       The block is not	currently allocated in the heap	or the
	       stack.

	  Other	diagnostics are	possible. If seen, they	indicate
	  corruption of	the internal state of MA, caused by bugs in
	  either MA or the application.

     <B>RETURN VALUE</B>
	  C: MA_TRUE upon success, MA_FALSE upon failure.
	  FORTRAN: .true. upon success,	.false.	upon failure.

     <B>NOTES</B>
	  Type-specific	data arrays are	not yet	available in C,	so
	  employ pointers instead of indices by	using MA_get_pointer()
	  instead of MA_get_index().
