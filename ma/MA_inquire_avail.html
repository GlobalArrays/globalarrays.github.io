     MA_INQUIRE_AVAIL


     <B>NAME</B>
	  MA_inquire_avail - find out how much free space is available
	  between the heap and stack regions

     <B>C SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "macdecls.h"

	  Integer MA_inquire_avail(datatype)
	      Integer	  datatype;	  /* read-only */

     <B>FORTRAN SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "mafdecls.h"

	  integer function MA_inquire_avail(datatype)
	      integer	  datatype

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
	  MA_inquire_avail() returns the maximum number	of elements of
	  type <I>datatype</I>	that can currently be allocated	in the space
	  between the heap and stack, in a single allocation request,
	  ignoring the partition defined at initialization.

	  Note that this might not be the largest piece	of memory
	  available; the heap may contain deallocated blocks that are
	  larger.

     <B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
	  MA not yet initialized
	       MA_init() must be called	before this routine is called.
	  invalid datatype: %d
	       <I>datatype</I>	must be	one of those listed in macdecls.h or
	       mafdecls.h.

     <B>RETURN VALUE</B>
	  C: The number	of elements, as	described above.
	  FORTRAN: The number of elements, as described	above.
