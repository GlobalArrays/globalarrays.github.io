     MA_SUMMARIZE_ALLOCATED_BLOCKS


     <B>NAME</B>
	  MA_summarize_allocated_blocks	- print	information about
	  currently allocated blocks on	the standard output (stdout)

     <B>C SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "macdecls.h"

	  void MA_summarize_allocated_blocks()

     <B>FORTRAN SYNOPSIS</B>
	  #include "mafdecls.h"

	  subroutine MA_summarize_allocated_blocks

     <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
	  MA_summarize_allocated_blocks() prints the following
	  information on the standard output (stdout) for each block
	  currently allocated on the heap or the stack.

	  address
	       The location in memory of (i.e.,	pointer	to) the	block.
	  handle
	       The memhandle by	which the block	is referenced
	       (returned when the block	was allocated).
	  name
	       The name	of the block (specified	when the block was
	       allocated).
	  type of elements
	       The type	of data	elements stored	in the block
	       (specified when the block was allocated).
	  number of elements
	       The number of data elements stored in the block
	       (specified when the block was allocated).
	  address of client space
	       The location in memory of (i.e.,	pointer	to) the	data
	       elements. This is the value returned by
	       MA_get_pointer().
	  index	for client space
	       The base	index for the appropriate type-specific	data
	       array.  This is the value returned by MA_get_index().
	  total	number of bytes
	       The total number	of bytes, including overhead, in the
	       block.

     <B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
	  invalid index_base: %d
	       This indicates either that the internal state of	MA is
	       corrupted or that there is a problem in the C-FORTRAN
	       linkage.

     <B>RETURN VALUE</B>
	  C: None.
	  FORTRAN: None.
