<P>TCGMSG is a toolkit for writing portable parallel programs using a message
passing model. Supported are a variety of common UNIX workstations, mini-super
and super computers and heterogenous networks of the same, along with true
parallel computers such as the Cray T3D/E, IBM SP, Intel Paragon, the Kendall
Square Research KSR-2, and several others. Applications port between all
of these environments without modification to the parallel constructs.

<P>Strong typing is enforced. The type associated with a message when sent
must match the type specified on the corresponding receive. No wildcard
types are permitted.</P>

<P>Processes are connected with ordered, synchronous channels. On machines
that explicitly support it explicitly asynchronous communication is supported.
Otherwise it should be thought that:</P>

<UL>
<LI>sends block until the message is explicitly received</LI>

<LI>messages from a particular process can only be received in the order
sent.</LI>
</UL>

<P>As far as buffering provided by the transport layer permits, messages
are actually sent without any synchronization between the sender and receiver.
However, since the amount of buffering varies greatly from one mechanism
to another you should not explicitly use this fact. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The documentation is provided with the package
and is also available in <A HREF="TCGapi.html">on-line</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Distribution</FONT></FONT></I></P>

<P>The latest copy of the library is <A HREF="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/distribution.html">distributed
with the Global Arrays package</A> without
charge, along with a set of example applications. In addition,
a port of TCGMSG on top of MPI is distributed.</P>
